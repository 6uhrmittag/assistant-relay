WebCore is the "web Community's own Rule Engine", and is a general rule engine for SmartThings.  It works by allowing users to create scripts that are interpreted and executed by SmartThings to allow for complex decision making.

As Assistant Relay exposes the Assistant Service as a REST API, it is possible to call Assistant Relay from a WebCore piston.

## Importing a Piston

To make things simple, I have created a default piston that should help get your started.  Simply use the import code `cg3ry`
